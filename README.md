# Canvas
A program that allows the user to create works of art using different tools such as a paint brush, pen, and spray paint. Canvas was created as a final group project for my Fundamentals of Computing I course at the University of Notre Dame. The other contributors to this project were Erin Flynn and Leah Plofchan. The included gfx graphics library was created by Ramzi Bualuan. 

To use Canvas, the user can select a tool and a color, and begin painting on the white canvas by clicking and holding the mouse, and dragging. At any time, the user can change the color or tool, or clear the entire canvas by selecting the clear tool. To quit, the user can press 'q' or exit the window.
